# PSDI Workflow
This folder contains the jupyter notebooks and  and input files required to reproduce the 
results of nine papers from the UKCH. The papers were selected because they link to published data
required to reproduce the results.

The notebooks are built following the Athena, Artemis and examples provided by Bruce Ravel 
([XAS fitting example](https://github.com/bruceravel/XAS-Education/tree/master/Examples/FeS2),
[Bruce Ravel XAS course 2011](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Spectroscopy/Techniques/XAS.html)). 
The specific Larch functions used are taken from the [Larch documentation](https://xraypy.github.io/xraylarch/xafs/).

This example uses Larch and Juptyer, instead of using Athena and Artemis (Demeter).

The first part of each notebook indicates the article whose are results being reproduced and the required data to run the notebooks.   

Subsequent markdown cells indicate the data mappings and the result(s) being reproduced in subsequent code cells.

# At the end of each notebook, you can find some notes on the reproducibility of results and some ideas to discuss further improvements.

The funding for the research and development of these examples came from the 
collaboration of UKCH with the STFC Scientific Computing Department in the 
"Phisical Sciences Research Infrastructure (PSDI) Phase 1 Pilot" (ESPRC 
EP/W032252/1) and also from UK Catalysis Hub (funded by EPSRC grants: EP/R026939/1, EP/R026815/1, EP/R026645/1, EP/R027129/1, and EP/M013219/1(biocatalysis))
