# XAS-Workflow-Demo
 
A showcase of the alternatives for implementing an XAS processing and analysis workflow
using different combinations of software and languages.

The tasks of the basic workflow are shown in the image below.

Each folder contains an end-to-end example of a workflow. They are described as follows. 
- [Basic Workflow](https://github.com/scman1/XAS-Workflow-Demo/blob/main/basic_workflow)
(GUI Workflow): The data and tasks performed in the basic workflow 
are the same as those used in the XAS-Education example from 
[Bruce Ravel](https://github.com/bruceravel/XAS-Education/tree/master/Examples/FeS2). 
The folder also contains a mark-down file describing the workflow tasks (see 
[README.md](https://github.com/scman1/XAS-Workflow-Demo/blob/main/basic_workflow/README.md)).
- [Demeter Workflow](https://github.com/scman1/XAS-Workflow-Demo/blob/main/demeter_workflow) 
(Scripted Workflow): is derived from the 
[FeS2 worked example](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter/tree/master/examples/recipes/FeS2). 
The first part this workflow was developed following examples from the Demeter 
[Programing guide](https://bruceravel.github.io/demeter/documents/DPG/index.html), 
while the second part is a modified version of the [FeS2 worked example](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter/tree/master/examples/recipes/FeS2). 
A mark-down file describing the workflow tasks is located at  
[README.md](https://github.com/scman1/XAS-Workflow-Demo/blob/main/basic_workflow/README.md).
