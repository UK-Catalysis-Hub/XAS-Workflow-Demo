# XAS-Workflow-Demo
 
A showcase of the alternatives for implementing an XAS processing and analysis workflow
using different combinations of software and languages.

Each folder contains an end-to-end example of a workflow. They are described as follows. 
- Basic Workflow (Interactive Workflow): The data and tasks performed in the basic workflow 
are the same as those used in the XAS-Education example from 
[Bruce Ravel](https://github.com/bruceravel/XAS-Education/tree/master/Examples/FeS2). 
- The larch and demeter workflows data and tasks are also from 
[Bruce Ravel](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter/tree/master/examples/recipes/FeS2).
