Each folder contains an end-to-end example of a workflow. They are described as follows. 
- [Basic Workflow](https://github.com/scman1/XAS-Workflow-Demo/blob/main/basic_workflow)
(Interactive Workflow): The data and tasks performed in the basic workflow 
are the same as those used in the XAS-Education example from 
[Bruce Ravel](https://github.com/bruceravel/XAS-Education/tree/master/Examples/FeS2). 
The folder also contains a mark-down file describing the workflow tasks (see [basic_wf.md](https://github.com/scman1/XAS-Workflow-Demo/blob/main/basic_workflow/basic_wf.md)).
- The larch and demeter workflows data and tasks are also from 
[Bruce Ravel](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter/tree/master/examples/recipes/FeS2).
