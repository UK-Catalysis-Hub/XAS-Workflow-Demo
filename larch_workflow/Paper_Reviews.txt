Paper 1: 
	- E0 Values - decide which E0
  	- LCF Percentages - determine which standards
	- Fit Comparisons - compare fit values

The problems we have detected so far are

We have concluded the first part of the exercise. In this case we are able to replicate the results up to a point in which we can not reduce the difference between the published results and the results produced by the workflows. At this point we need to take a step back and evaluate our procedures but we need an expert to:

a) corroborate if the results reported by the workflow represent an honest attempt to reproduce the published results
b) verify that we have not introduced errors by following non-standard or erroneous procedures
c) suggest improvements which could make improve the accuracy of our reproduction efforts

At the end we would report on this evaluation and on the improvements as a candidates for improving the reproducibility of research results in catalysis research as well as to encourage better data publishing practices.
