# PSDI Workflow
This folder contains the script and input files required to reproduce the 
results of nine papers from the UKCH which are linked to the published data
required to reproduce the results.

The script is build followint the Athena, Artemis and examples provided by Bruce Ravel 
([XAS fitting example](https://github.com/bruceravel/XAS-Education/tree/master/Examples/FeS2),
[Bruce Ravel XAS course 2011](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Spectroscopy/Techniques/XAS.html)).

This example uses Demeter and Perl directly, instead of using Athena and Artemis.

The script is meant to be run from the command line as:
 `perl reproduce_pub.pl athena groups file (.csv ) operartions list (.csv)`

For instance, the provided files:
 `perl reproduce_pub.pl pub_037_athena.csv pub_037_operations.csv`
 
# Athena groups file
The athena groups file is a csv file that contains a list of athena project 
files and groups to be used in the script to reproduce the results.

The file should contain no headers, and each line contains three columns: Athena
file, Data group name, Display name for instance the first two lines of the 
pub_037_athena.csv file presented below include the name of two athena files, 
including the path to get to the files, the name of the groups to be imported 
(used) and the names to be assigned to those groups in the operations.

`..\psdi_data\pub_037\XAFS_prj\SnO2 0.9 2.6-13.5 gbkg.prj,SnO2 0.9,SnO2`<br>
`..\psdi_data\pub_037\XAFS_prj\Sn K-edge\PtSn_OCO.prj,PtSn_OCO rebinned,air`


## Operations File
The operations list file is a csv file that contains a list of operations 
which need to be performed to reproduce published results.

The provied example files are required to reproduce the results from Huang et. al.[1], 
using supporting data published with the article [2].
