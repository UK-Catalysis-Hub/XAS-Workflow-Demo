# PSDI Workflow
This folder contains the script and input files required to reproduce the 
results of nine papers from the UKCH which are linked to the published data
required to reproduce the results.

The script is build followint the Athena, Artemis and examples provided by Bruce Ravel 
([XAS fitting example](https://github.com/bruceravel/XAS-Education/tree/master/Examples/FeS2),
[Bruce Ravel XAS course 2011](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Spectroscopy/Techniques/XAS.html).

The main difference is that this example uses Demeter and Perl directly, instead of using Athena 
and Artemis.

The funding for the research and development of this example came from the 
collaboration of UKCH with the STFC Scientific Computing Department in the 
"Phisical Sciences Research Infrastructure (PSDI) Phase 1 Pilot" (ESPRC 
EP/W032252/1).
